# Google-Home-Page

A Clone of Google home page with no features just for show page.

You can hover on the gogle apps section to see the apps in the drawer but the google id image is not working where as the searching buttons are just for show but below the buttons the language section clicking on any language wil redirect to wikipedia.
And the gmail and Images link will also redirect to actual Gmail and Images page.
It also has non-working google lens and google mic button which on hover changes the cursor.

Here aree some screenshots of the page -
